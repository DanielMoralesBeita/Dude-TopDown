# Adventures of Dude in the Top-Down world
A game developed in Python, using PyGame, which purpose is to test out a genetic algorithm and compare it to a finite state machine.

This project was conceived as a final paper on my computing science graduation at Instituto Federal de EducaÃ§ao, Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sul de Minas Gerais, Muzambinho (Brazil).

My goal now, with this, is to distribute openly for anyone who's into game development (specially with Python) and Artificial Intelligence for games.

Since this was my first PyGame project, my code is a little messy (the game itself is not and object, for exemple) and any contribution is not only welcome, as it is encouraged.

If you use this code and want to redistribute it, it is distributed under GPL, so just leave the header and you are free to go!

Thanks for your support.

# Setting up

Python version 2.7
To be able to execute the Game, must have the 'PyGame' Library, and then, execute the 'Game.py' file.

- Installing PyGame:
    - Windows:
        - open the cmd (windows+r -> cmd)
        - navigate to your 'Python' folder (usually at C:/Python27) and than to the 'Scripts' folder. (Ex - cd C:/Python27/Scripts)
        - execute the command 'pip install pygame'
    - Linux:
        - use your package manager to install 'pip' (Ex - 'sudo apt-get install pip')
        - run 'pip install pygame'

# TODOs

- Animation of genetic pool methods when passing a level
- Code refactoring to make the game loop and variables part of an object
- New maps for levels
- Better in-game UI
- ~Optimize music and sounds for better sync~
- General optimization
